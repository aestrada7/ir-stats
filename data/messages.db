The best place is entry of 3, pushing as far as we can on the top lane. No need to downshift, just break lightly and gently apply back throttle. Doing 20.5s, need to find at least a couple extra tenths to be competitive.\n\nAfter fiddling around a bit with the WJ, was able to get 20.4s consistently, and a best of 20.2. Need to break way before on the frontstretch to allow the car to roll through one and two, that's where we're losing time. 3 & 4 can be on the top for a lot of speed, or can also be way down on the yellow line, just need to break a bit before if using that low lane, otherwise only need to lift a bit.","_id":"YQrB1WWfmpCIHV4s"}
