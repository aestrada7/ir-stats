Spun a lot at the beginning of the week, ended up much smoother after. With a bit more practice we could have easily reached 1:47s, not quite there with the high 1:44s of the aliens, but I know for a fact of a couple places where time was lost, Turn 6 (blind right hander) comes to mind where there's more speed. Turn 8 I started breaking a little earlier (around the 3 marker) being extra safe so there's some more tenths there. Canada Corner, pretty sure there's around another second just from the way I'm attacking the corner.\n\nThere aren't very many passing zones, or there are but they are tough on lower splits because people are erratic. The most obvious one is Turn 1, need to send it and hope the other car gives room. Turn 3 is a good passing zone if telegraphed early, otherwise it's a bit dive bomb-ish. Turn 5 is a given, but quite dangerous due to the different breaking points for varying skill levels, and if people inadvertently swerve it's race over. Turn 8 can is borderline, but too risky, better to wait until Canada Corner, but that also needs to be telegraphed early. Turn 14 can also be a passing opportunity depending on the lines that are taken.\n\nOverall, a solid weekend, and Road America is a blast in Indycars, hopefully we'll be able to improve on these places next time the series comes around, also we never used the P2P, there can be additional tenths from using that on the straightaway, another thing to look at is the break bias, which might help gain a bit more.\n","_id":"JdrKTMsd8b5P4M9G"}
