With a bit more practice we could have easily reached 1:47s, not quite there with the high 1:44s of the aliens, but I know for a fact of a couple places where time was lost, Turn 6 (blind right hander) comes to mind where there's more speed. Turn 8 I started breaking a little earlier (around the 3 marker) being extra safe so there's some more tenths there. Canada Corner, pretty sure there's around another second just from the way I'm attacking the corner.\n\nThere aren't very many passing zones, or there are but they are tough on lower splits because people are erratic. The most obvious one is Turn 1, need to send it and hope the other car gives room. Turn 3 is a good passing zone if telegraphed early, otherwise it's a bit dive bomb-ish. Turn 5 is a given, but quite dangerous due to the different breaking points for varying skill levels, and if people inadvertently swerve it's race over. Turn 8 can is borderline, but too risky, better to wait until Canada Corner, but that also needs to be telegraphed early. Turn 14 can also be a passing opportunity depending on the lines that are taken.\n\nOverall, a solid weekend, and Road America is a blast in Indycars, hopefully we'll be able to improve on these places next time the series comes around, also we never used the P2P, there can be additional tenths from using that on the straightaway, another thing to look at is the break bias, which might help gain a bit more.\n","_id":"JdrKTMsd8b5P4M9G"}

Basically make sure to stay in the draft and run +3 WJ while pursuing someone. This can potentially hurt tires, but allows to run the extreme top without losing any speed. In clean air move it back to +1 or 0, and hug the inside line flat out. Leaders can easily separate themselves from the pack by passing each other on the straights, that's what Nick and Robert did on the last race, I just followed them around on the extreme top with clean air and was able to stay with them the entire race to finish P3 more than a second ahead of P4.","_id":"c3eFfu6lTRxWKyWe"}

We were really abusing the tires, and that's what the first two results show (P9, P12) - in those we had 19% and 5% left of the thread. Not good. Did a bunch of testing to find out what we were doing different, we definitely need to shift down to 4th entering the turns, AND we need to take a bit of a higher line. Race 3 (P13) we crashed out while leading because the car got crazy loose on exit of two and tried to save it instead of locking it down, should've adjusted the WJ to 0 or even -1. Race 4 (P12) everything that could go wrong went wrong, started using the VR headset, was unable to qualify, missed the start, the pedals configuration was lost, the streamdeck buttons didn't work (so I overfueled) and to top it off, the guy in front of us wrecked coming to the green, so we got penalized for missing the wreck. Race 5 (P6) we led laps on strategy, then came back from P11 to P5 in the last couple of laps only to be passed on the last lap. Race 6 (P14) we started almost dead last but were easily able to carve our way through using the top of the top lines, eventually took the lead on speed and led for a while until the car got crazy loose and spun out like on the other one. Locked it down but was mired back in P18 - a slew of cautions didn't let us get a better result.\n\nOverall - race in VR as it gives much better depth perception and use the top of the top lanes, especially in 3 and 4, make sure to downshift to 4th, and then when on clean air move to the bottom but use the weight jacker to stabilize the car (0 or -1)","_id":"hD9IW0SL6VO1ImWf"}
